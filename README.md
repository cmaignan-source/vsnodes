# Custom Node Collection for ALLPLAN VisualScripting

Welcome to this GitHub project — a **set of custom nodes** for the **ALLPLAN** VisualScripting solution.

## About the Project

This repository offers a collection of custom VisualScripting nodes designed to enhance and extend the capabilities of visual scripting in ALLPLAN. VisualScripting allows you to create parametric objects and automate processes without programming skills — simply by connecting nodes, which represent code blocks or functions, in a graphical interface.

## Features

- **Easy-to-use custom nodes**
- Seamlessly integrated into the ALLPLAN VisualScripting library

## Requirements

- ALLPLAN 2026 or later

## Installation

1. **Download** the custom nodes into the VisualScripting directory with the ALLPLAN Content connector.
2. The new nodes will appear in the Custome Library.

## Usage

- Create a new VisualScripting project in ALLPLAN.
- Drag and drop the nodes from this project into your workspace.
- Configure their properties according to your needs (geometry, logic, input/output).
- Connect the nodes to create data flows or action sequences.
- Run the script: the result will be displayed in real time within the ALLPLAN view.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can propose new nodes, report bugs, or suggest improvements by opening an issue or a pull request.
